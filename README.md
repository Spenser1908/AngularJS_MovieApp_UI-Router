In this app you’ll find examples of the following Angular features:

Basic Routing Structure:

index.html 	// Loads CSS and JS files

    movieForm.html 	// Template & Layout
    
		step1.html 	   // Views (all 4 “step” files)
		step2.html
		step3.html
		step4.html

Description:

I created this Movie Project App in order to learn Angular JS and familiarize myself more with Bootstrap. This app also features a UI-Router, which I found to be very useful in moving from page to page. The purpose of this app is to help the user find a movie. The user has the ability to search for a movie in a variety of ways. They can search via titles, genres, or ratings. Each option will eventually return a list of movie titles matching their criteria. The user can then select the movie they want to, and the app brings user to the final page, where they can select a Movie Theater, time, and number of tickets.
